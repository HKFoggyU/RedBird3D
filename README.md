3D model for HKUST Redbird (Sundial)

## Usage

Download the `` redbird2Print.stl `` or `` redbird2PrintX4.stl `` and print it with a 3D printer.

## Modify

Follow the order of:
```
redbird.jpg => redbird.psd => redbird*.png => redbird*.3mf => redbird2Print*.stl
```
to create this 3D model from a photo taken by my phone because I did not find any specific parameters about the Redbird.

## Preview

The colors are just to make parts distinguishable.
